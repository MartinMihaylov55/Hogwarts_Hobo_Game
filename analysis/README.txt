Hogwarts Hobo Game

Dependancies: Python 3.7

How to use: Run "StartGame.py" to perform a simulation. The player will use a simple machine learning algorithm to calculate which track is the safest to jump on based on info learned from hobos and getting hit by trains.

Output: How long the simulated player survived the tunnel
